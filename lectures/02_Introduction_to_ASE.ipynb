    "[The atomistic simulation environment](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/index.html) (ASE) is an extremely powerful tool for generating atomic structures and performing density functional theory calculations (DFT.) ASE allows you to manipulate atomic structures in a programitic way using the [ASE atoms object](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/atoms.html). This is a `class` in python that can store the positions and identities of atoms in a structure and manipulate them in useful ways. This is pretty abstract, so here is an example of generating an atoms object:"
