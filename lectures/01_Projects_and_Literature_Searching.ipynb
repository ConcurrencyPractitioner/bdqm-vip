    "You will be provided with some example input scripts for performing DFT calculations of a chemical system. You will need to modify the script by adding/removing/changing atoms in various ways and re-running the calculations to generate new data. You will record the results and the locations of the calculations which will be used for various projects in the group.\n",

    "You will be provided with a set of data corresponding to the inputs (atomic structures) and outputs (energies and forces) for a set of atomistic simulations. Your task will be to use existing software packages to i) vectorize the atomic structures using various strategies and 2) train a neural network model to predict the energies and forces given a new atomic structure. You will be provided with an initial script and the current best model, and your goal is to modify the hyper-parameters of the vectorization and neural network training to improve the accuracy of the machine learning model.\n",
