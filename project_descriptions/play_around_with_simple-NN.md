# Play Around with Simple-NN

Simple\_NN is a python package out of South Korea for generating machine learned potential energy surfaces (known as neural network forcefields or NN-FF). These are models that can be trained reproduce the results of DFT but at much lower cost. 

For this project, you will first try to get farmiliar with the package by training an example NN-FF with known hyper-parameters, before play with hyper-parameters trying to create better models


## Midterm Goal:

* Get farmiliar with NN-FF concepts
* Generate training data with psi4 package (clusters of water molecule?)
* Train a neural network forcefield to the data with provided hyper-parameters to have a force RMSE of 0.07 eV/A



### Midterm Deliverables:
Trained NN-FF example model


## Final Goal:


* Tune the hyper-parameter for better force prediction
* Test the models with a test molecular dynamics simulation



### Final Deliverables:
Trained NN-FF models and test run results
