# Machine Learning - Neural Network Training for ???

Advisor: ???

You are given a dataset containing... this is relevant scientifically because...

You are encouraged, but not required, to use the Simple NN software package for training. The current best RMSE for energies is ??? and forces is ???. You can improve this by modifying the NN architecture (number of layers/nodes, activation function), initialization scheme, or any other strategy you can think of.

## Midterm Goal:
Train a model that matches the current best accuracy.


### Midterm Deliverable:
zip file with ??? that can be loaded by the script ???.

## Final Goal:
Train a model that has lower errors than the current best accuracy.

### Final Deliverable:
zip file with ??? that can be loaded by the script ???.
