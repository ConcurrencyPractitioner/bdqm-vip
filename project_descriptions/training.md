# Big Data and Quantum Mechanics Traning Project

This project covers basic training for 1) generating data using quantum-mechanical simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) and 2) using machine learning to create models that predict the outcome of these simulations based on large datasets.

## Midterm Goal:
Compute the adsorption energy of carbon monoxide (CO) on a Pt(111) surface using DFT on the PACE computing cluster. You will use a plane-wave cutoff of 400 eV and a k-point mesh of (4,4,1) to compute the adsorption energy.

### Midterm Deliverables:
* A text file containing the path to the directory of the DFT calculation on the PACE cluster and the computed adsorption energy.

## Final Goal:
Train a neural-network model to predict the energies and forces of ???

### Final Deliverables:
* ???
