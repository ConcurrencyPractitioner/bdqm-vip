# Data Generation - Nitrogen Reactivity of p-Block Dopants on Oxides

Photocatalytic nitrogen fixation is an interesting new reaction that has the potential to create fertilizers from air. Research in the Medford group has explored many aspects of this reaction, and it was recently discovered that carbon impurities on titania (TiO2) may be the key to enabling the reaction. However, the role of other p-block elements has not been explored. One important factor in enabling this reaction is the relative reactivity between molecular nitrogen (N2) and molecular oxygen (O2), both of which are present in air. Surfaces that are preferentially reactive toward N2 are particularly promising for photocatalytic nitrogen fixation.

In this project you will compute the adsorption energies of N2 and O2 molecules on TiO2 surfaces that have p-block elements substituted for surface oxygen. You will compute the adsorption energies of these two molecules with the following elements substituted for the surface oxygen: B, C, N, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Se, Br. For each surface you will compare the ratio of the adsorption energies to identify promising materials.

## Midterm Goal:

Complete DFT calculations for N2 and O2 adsorbed with the following elements substituted for the surface oxygen:

* B, C, N, F

### Midterm Deliverables:
A spreadsheet containing adsorption energies for N2 and O2 on each surface, along with the paths where the calculations were performed on PACE. A template for the spreadsheet will be provided.

## Final Goal:

Complete the DFT calculations for N2 and O2 on with all p-block substitutions.

### Final Deliverables:
Updated spreadsheet including energies for N2 and O2 on all surfaces.
