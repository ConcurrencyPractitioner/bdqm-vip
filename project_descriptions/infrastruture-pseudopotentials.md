#DFT Infrastructure- Pseudopotential Generation
Advisor: Prof. Phanish Suryanarayana

## Introduction 

The pseudopotential framework is crucial to density functional theory (DFT) simulations, especially for heavy elements with >10 electrons. The framework is widely used, but there are many possible formalisms, each with numerous parameters that must be tuned to provide efficient, accurate, and transferable pseudopotentials. Recently, our group along with others applied an evolutionary algorithm for multi-objective optimization to create a new set of pseudopotentials, called the "Soft Pseudopotentials from Multiobjective optimization Scheme" or SPMS set. The purpose of this sub-team is to improve accessibility and quality of these pseudopotentials.


## Project Description

This team will start by creating a user-friendly website for organizing the SPMS psuedopotentials. The files are currently available via a Github repository, but this is difficult for new users to navigate. The task for this semester is to develop a graphical website similar to that of PseudoDOJO (http://www.pseudo-dojo.org/) or SSSP (https://www.materialscloud.org/discover/sssp) to help keep the SPMS set organized and make it more usable for newcomers.


## Midterm Goals

By the midterm, you are expected to have a familiarity with the SPMS pseudopotential set, and understand the basic variables that can change to yield different sets in the future (e.g. different levels of accuracy, different exchange-correlation functionals, etc.). You should create a plan for organizing the pseudopotential set and associated graphical interface.

### Midterm Deliverables

* A mock-up of how the pseudopotential website will appear, and how different options will be selected (pdf).

* An initial demonstration of a website that allows downloading at least one pseudopotential (txt file with link to website and description).

## Final Goal

By the final, you are expected to have a prototype of a graphical interface for downloading SPMS pseudopotentials.

### Final Deliverables

* A text file describing how to access and use the website (txt file)

* A website that can be used to download SPMS psuedopotentials (link provided in documentation .txt file)


## References

* Add reference to SPMS paper once it is available.
