# SPARC-X Pythin Interface

SPARC-X is an open source computational framework for performing Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations that scale linearly with system size, leveraging petascale/exascale parallel computers to study chemical phenomena at length and time scales previously accessible only by empirical approaches (www.sparc-x.com)

Your goal for this project is creating a python interface for SPARC-X code which is written in C++. The interface should not only be able to launch SPARC-X calculations, but also extracting intermidiate results from the calculations


## Midterm Goal:

* Get Farmiliar with Cython and launch an example C++ code with python on local machine and PACE. Document what you have learned.
* Write a python interface for running the main function of SPARC-X with given input files. 


### Midterm Deliverables:

* Documentations of the example Cython interface
* Script for running the main function of SPARC-X with python


## Final Goal:

* Get farmiliar with SPARC-X structure
* Choose some functions with graduate student advisers and write python interfaces to them (with function results returned to python). 
* Document your strategies/findings.


### Final Deliverables:

* Python interfaces of the chosen functions
* Documentations
