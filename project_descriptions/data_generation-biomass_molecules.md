# Data Generation - Adsorption Energies of Biomass Molecules on Metal Surfaces

Sugars and sugar alcohols are industrially important as precursors to a variety of fine chemicals and sorbitol (one of sugar alcohols) is identified as one of the top 10 biorefinery products by the DOE. In this project, you will to calculate the adsorption energy of some important sugars and sugar derivatives like glucose and sorbitol on different transition-metal slabs to understand the binding energy and geometry of these compounds on each surface. This will help in the development of biomass catalysts.

In this project you will compute the adsorption energies of the following molecules on Pt, Ru, Au, Cu, and Rh (111) surfaces. You should try at least 3 different initial guesses for the binding geometry of each molecule on each surface. You will use the ASE package in python to build the structures and Quantum Espresso is used for the DFT calculation. You can also practice coding by scripting Python to build structures, re-submit jobs, and organize/analyze data.

Molecules to compute:
* 

You should use the following parameters for the DFT calculation:

## Midterm Goal:

Complete the DFT calculations for the following molecules:

*


### Midterm Deliverables:
A spreadsheet containing adsorption energies for each of the molecules in all different binding configurations, along with the paths where the calculations were performed on PACE. A template for the spreadsheet will be provided.

## Final Goal:

Complete the DFT calculations for all molecules.

### Final Deliverables:
Updated spreadsheet including energies for all molecules on all surfaces in all configurations.
